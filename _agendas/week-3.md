### Homework

- 1. Select a new object for the animated poster.
  2. Write a description describing the object in as clear and specific language as possible. Also describe why you selected it.
  3. Working at a 2:3 aspect ratio (2000 x 3000px) begin sketching ideas for your poster. Do not start animating! Aim for 10 different variations experimenting with the form. Remember that design is frequently an addition or subtraction problem – if you&rsquo;re adding anything, make sure to have intentions behind it and consider how it communicate the overall form.
