- Come up with three different collection ideas for the next project. Create a presentation that visually introduces the objects, explains what you&rsquo;re interested in exploring with this object, and a few different execution ideas (collage of the textures, close up photos, hi res scans...). Include art direction notes for each execution (include visual references of what you might try to do.)
