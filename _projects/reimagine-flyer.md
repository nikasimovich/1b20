### Overview
Find a poster/flyer that’s hung up on campus. Using all the written information, deconstruct it and create a poster for it that looks nothing like the original. Consider the original messaging and decide whether to maintain or revise the hierarchy.  Next, create a digital component that compliments your printed piece. Hang the printed one around campus and take a photo of it in context. Email the digital piece to someone at the school.

### Task
11" × 17" print; 1200 × 1200 or 1080 × 1920px digital component; a presentation that highlights your process and deconstruction
